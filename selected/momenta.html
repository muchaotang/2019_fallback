						<h1>Momentä&nbsp;- The Fitness app</h1><ul><li>Product Design &amp;&nbsp;Strategy (ongoing side project)</li></ul><h2>Background</h2><h3>What is Momentä</h3><p style="margin-left:40px"><em>Finding the perfect Gym Partner. Simplified.<br>Workout Transcription. Revolutionized.</em></p><p><strong>Momentä is the one-stop shop for reaching your fitness goals.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Why Momentä</h3><p>Each and every one of us has found ourselves wanting to live a healthier lifestyle. Millions of people across the United States alone start each new year with the hopes of becoming more active, living a happier life, and making a change to their unhealthy habits. Whether it involves weight lifting at a gym or running outdoors, people make a valiant effort towards making the change.</p><p>However, most of these individuals lack something that can truly make the difference in living a healthier lifestyle.<br><br><strong>What these individuals lack is - motivation.<br><br>What these individuals need is - Momentä.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>My role</h3><p>I lead the research and design of the Momentä app across iOS and Android, in this multi-disciplinary team of 3 engineers, 1 product manager and 1 designer.</p><p><strong>User insights</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>I partnered with the product manager to uncover insights from literatures, interviews and surveys,&nbsp;and translate concepts into features that address user pain points.</p><p><strong>Planning &amp; scope definition</strong></p><p>I defined the product with my product manager, and then share the vision with the whole team to reach common ground.</p><p><strong>Leadership</strong></p><p>I designed up and presented works to gain buy-in from engineers and pm throughout the project lifecycle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Research</h2><h3>Literature Review</h3><p>1. <strong>More motivation</strong> and <strong>workout partner </strong>are among the <strong>top factors</strong> that would lead exercisers to <strong>exercise more</strong> or non-exercisers to <strong>begin to exercise</strong>.</p><blockquote>"In the present study, non-exercisers were asked to identify the factors that would lead them to exercise. Themes such as “more time,” “fewer demands,” and <strong>“more motivation”</strong> were consistent with the barriers identified in this study such as “no time,” “other priorities,” and “no motivation.” However, non-exercisers also identified themes including <strong>“workout partner or group”</strong> and “better facility location” as part of the top five remedies to overcome the barriers identified by non-exercisers."</blockquote>

						<p>-- Ebben, William, and Laura Brudzynski. "MOTIVATIONS AND BARRIERS TO EXERCISE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS."&nbsp;<em>Journal of Exercise Physiology Online</em>&nbsp;11.5 (2008).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Individuals<strong> tend to exercise more intensely</strong> when they <strong>exercise right to someone</strong>&nbsp;they perceive to be high fit.</p><blockquote>Implications of this research might suggest that individuals attempting to exercise more intensely could benefit by exercising right to someone they perceive to be high fit.</blockquote><blockquote>A high fit individual might benefit more from either exercising alone or exercising with another high fit individual. Exercising with someone more fit than oneself could promote a higher intensity workout (Daley and Huffen, 2005).</blockquote><p>-- Plante, Thomas G., et al. "Effects of perceived fitness level of exercise partner on intensity of exertion." (2010).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. <strong>Aerobic exercise session</strong>&nbsp;with a partner <strong>tends to be longer</strong> than working out alone.</p><blockquote>The participants in the study were divided into three groups that rode an exercise bike at a given percentage of their heart rate for time. The first group was a control, and they exercised alone. The second worked out with a single partner.<strong>&nbsp;The third group worked out with a single partner and was told that the results of their test were based on the partner with the weaker performance.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>In the end, solo riders made it an average of 10.6 minutes on the bike before stopping. Pretty good. Group two, the ones that rode with a partner on screen, went on for an average of 19.8 minutes. That’s an 87% difference. <strong>The third group was on the bike for an average of 21.9 minutes, an improvement just over double than going it alone.</strong>&nbsp;Tell me that’s not impressive.</blockquote><p>--&nbsp;Irwin, B. C., Scorniaenchi, J., Kerr, N. L., Eisenmann, J. C., &amp; Feltz, D. L. (2012).&nbsp;Aerobic exercise is promoted when individual performance affects the group: A test of the kohler motivation gain effect.&nbsp;<em>Annals of Behavioral Medicine</em>,&nbsp;<em>44</em>(2), 151-159.&nbsp;</p>


						<h3>Interview</h3><p>We did 6 semi-structured interviews to learn about training from an overall perspective.&nbsp;Participants vary from joggers who casually run for 1-3 times on a weekly basis, to swimmers who receive intense professional trainings every day to compete in national tournaments. The huge span among different types of trainers provides us with a holistic view of what training actually means to different people.</p><h3>Survey&nbsp;</h3><p>We conducted an online survey in several sub-reddits relevant to fitness training,&nbsp;received 193 responses in total,&nbsp;with 111 of the respondents, which is 58% of the total number,&nbsp;being students. Also, we got tons of subjective feedbacks on what people seek from a fitness app, which helped form up our product principles.</p><h3>Insights</h3><p><strong>General</strong></p><ul><li>Users <strong>don’t want to waste time</strong> in pairing up with partners to go exercising</li><li>Users want to pair up with <strong>certain type of gym buddies</strong></li><li>Users need incentives or <strong>motivations</strong> to keep training</li><li>Users need an <strong>easy way to record</strong> their training progress</li><li>More than 60% of <strong>students</strong> train almost everyday (a large proportion of the samples are from Georgia Tech)</li><li><strong>Students</strong> are <strong>more likely to train together</strong> with friends than other user groups</li></ul><p><strong>Target user</strong></p><p>Students show more interest in pairing up with others to train, together with a higher potential of becoming frequent users of fitness-related services.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>67% have systematically trained for some sports</li><li>64% train almost everyday</li></ul><p><strong>Train together VS alone</strong></p><p>46% say they prefer to train alone, and the reasons are:</p><ul><li>53% - I do not want interruption</li><li>43% - Easier to arrange time</li><li>40% - It is more effective</li><li>28% - It is hard to find a partner</li></ul><p>25% say they prefer to train with others, and the reasons are:</p><ul><li>78.57% - Friends encouraging each other makes it easier to keep on training</li><li>57.14% - I love hanging out with friends when training</li><li>32% - Others can provide protection while training</li></ul><p><strong>Training plan</strong></p><ul><li>80% - I have a training plan</li><li>29% - I make refinements based on others' plans</li><li>27% - I follow others' training plans &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>30% - I make the plan by myself with resources I find</li></ul><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Design</h2><h3>Experience principles</h3><ul><li><strong>Simplicity</strong><ul><li>Meeting gym buddies and scheduling training is easy beyond imagination.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Magical moments</strong><ul><li>"Wow" moments happen naturally throughout the process of finding gym buddy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Motivation</strong><ul><li>Users feel super pumped and eager for training every time they open the app.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Marketing Strategy</h3><p><strong>Stage 1</strong>&nbsp;- Together We Stronger</p><ul><li>Promote the concept of "<strong>Motivation</strong>" &amp; "<strong>Buddy</strong>"</li><li>Nature’s best motivator is competition and what better way to motivate you than to have someone that has a similar resolution train together?</li></ul><p><strong>Story</strong></p>
